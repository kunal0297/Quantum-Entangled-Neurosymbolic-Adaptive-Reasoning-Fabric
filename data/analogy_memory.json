One of the machines is programmed to always dispense a gold coin when its button is pressed, another is programmed to always dispense a silver coin, and the third machine is programmed to randomly dispense either a gold coin or nothing. You don't have any coins to start with. Your task is to determine the mechanism of each machine by pushing their buttons as few times as possible, but there's a catch: After you push a button, there is a cooling-off period where you must wait 15 minutes before you can push any button again. What is the fewest number of times you have to press the buttons to be certain of each machine's operation?",
